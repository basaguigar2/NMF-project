# NMF Project

## Description

The **NMF Project** is a Java-based application designed to process and analyze data, with a focus on muscle synergy analysis and matrix operations. The project includes tools for managing data inputs, performing complex calculations, and visualizing results through a user interface. It is structured with modular classes for scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Features

- Matrix manipulation and operations.
- Analysis of muscle synergies.
- Custom fraction operations.
- Interactive user interface for ease of use.
- Support for external file handling.

## File Structure

- **Files.java**: Handles external file operations like reading and writing data.
- **Fractions.java**: Manages fractional data and related calculations.
- **Matrix.java**: Implements operations and manipulations for matrices.
- **Matrix_Object.java**: Encapsulates matrix-related data and operations.
- **Muscles_selected.java**: Manages selected muscle data for synergy analysis.
- **Run_Interface.java**: Entry point for launching the user interface.
- **Interface_2.java & Interface_methods.java**: Define the logic and behavior of the user interface.
- **umldiagram.cld**: UML diagram illustrating the project's architecture.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- A Java IDE or text editor for development (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project as a ZIP file.
2. Extract the files to your desired directory.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
4. Ensure all dependencies are configured correctly.

## Usage

1. Run the `Run_Interface` class to launch the program.
2. Use the interactive interface to load data and perform analyses.
3. View results, including processed matrices and synergy data.

## UML Diagram

The project includes a UML diagram (`umldiagram.cld`) to help understand the structure and relationships between classes.
